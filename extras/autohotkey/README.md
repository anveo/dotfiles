# AutoHotkey Scripts

My collection of misc helper scripts

## Scripts

* `16x9_Center.ahk` - Hold `Ctrl+Mouse4` to resize and position the active
  window to a 16:9 aspect ratio. Useful for mixing an ultrawide monitor and
  streaming or screen sharing

* `CapsUnlocked.ahk` - When `CapsLock` is held down, it functions as a `Ctrl`
  key. When It's tapped, it functions as an `Esc` key

* `BravoTrim.ahk` - increase sensitivity for the Honeycomb Bravo throttle trim
  wheel since it's rotation emits button presses instead of being a dedicated
  axis
