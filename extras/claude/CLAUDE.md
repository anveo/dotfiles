# Global Configuration

Criticism is welcome.

* Please tell me when I am wrong or mistaken, or even when you think I might be wrong or mistaken.
* Please tell me if there is a better approach than the one I am taking.
* Please tell me if there is a relevant standard or convention that I appear to be unaware of.
* Feel free to ask many questions. If you are in doubt of my intent, don't guess. Ask.

## Plans

At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Inclusive Terminology

Use: allowlist/blocklist, primary/replica, placeholder/example, main branch, conflict-free, concurrent/parallel
