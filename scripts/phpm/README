Program: phpm 
Author: Havard Eide
Version: 0.3
License: GPL
Release: 20/11/2004

Quick description:
phpm is a program for accessing API calls for PHP libraries.
It was originally created to query the PHP manual from the shell,
but comes with a range of pre-generated project API's that can
be queried.

--------------
The files:
* generator.php 
  This is the XML generator: if you have a CVS dir with the
  PHP doc code - configure "settings.xml" and run this
  with "php epcmanual.php"
  
* reader.php
  This is the actual query tool: run it with
  "php reader.php mysql_query" to get the result.
  If a exact hit isn't found it will query the API for functions
  that start with the argument, if this fails the program will 
  try a wildcard query for anything that contains the argument.
  The "xml/*.xml" contains all the functions, pregenerated, so 
  you don't need to run the "generator.php" to generate it.

  To query a different project than the default:
  "php reader.php -p pro query" where "pro" is one of the projects listed 
  below.
 
* The "phpm" script
  You will need to symlink this to /usr/bin/, /usr/local/bin with:
  "sudo ln -s /Users/nucleuz/Sites/phpm/phpm /usr/bin/phpm"
  to make it work from anywhere in the terminal. 
  
  You will also need to change the first command to reference the folder
  where this program is installed
	
* xml files
  Update the settings.xml and point to a directory where you want
  the XML files to be stored. Download and copy the XML bundle from eide.org
  to this folder.
  
----------------
ToDo:
  - Versioning
  - Integrate with wordpress [Planned for v0.4]
  - Support for wildcard query [Done - v0.2]
  - Query for a class
  - Get extended result "-e" -> more text from the DocBook needs to be extracted. [Done -v0.3]
